1. In a particular city, the population proportion œÄ supports an increase in the minimum wage.
For a random sample of size 2, let Y = number who support an increase.

a. Assuming œÄ = 0.50, specify the probabilities for the possible values y for Y and find the distribution‚Äôs mean and standard deviation.

b. Suppose you observe y = 1 and do not know œÄ. 
Find and sketch the likelihood function. 
Using the plotted likelihood function, explain why the ML estimate œÄÀÜ = 0.50.


2. When the 2010 General Social Survey asked subjects in the US whether they would be willing to accept cuts 
in their standard of living to protect the environment, 486 of 1374 subjects said yes.

a. Estimate the population proportion who would say yes. Construct and interpret a 99% confidence interval for this proportion.

b. Conduct a significance test to determine whether a majority or minority of the population would say yes. 
Report and interpret the P-value.

*The Wald test, the score test, and the likelihood ratio test may yield the same conclusion regarding rejection, but the test statistics may differ.
When choosing one of the three methods, the analyst should select the most appropriate one. 
The likelihood ratio test is characterized by using the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) directly, while the score test always uses the maximized value of ùúã(ùúã0), 
resulting in a standard error (SE) that is always larger than that used in the Wald test, which employs pi-hat. 
Therefore, the z-value, which uses SE as the denominator, will be smaller, leading to a more conservative approach to rejection (less likely to reject the null hypothesis). 
SAS shows all three cases, but R applies different testing methods depending on the form used.
