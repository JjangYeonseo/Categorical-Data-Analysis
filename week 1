1. In a particular city, the population proportion œÄ supports an increase in the minimum wage.
For a random sample of size 2, let Y = number who support an increase.

a. Assuming œÄ = 0.50, specify the probabilities for the possible values y for Y and find the distribution‚Äôs mean and standard deviation.

b. Suppose you observe y = 1 and do not know œÄ. 
Find and sketch the likelihood function. 
Using the plotted likelihood function, explain why the ML estimate œÄÀÜ = 0.50.

Assuming œÄ = 0.50, we can find the probabilities for the possible values of y for Y. 
Since we have a sample size of 2, there are three possible values for Y: 0, 1, and 2. - P(Y = 0): This is the probability that both individuals in the sample do not support an increase in the minimum wage. 
Since œÄ = 0.50, the probability of not supporting an increase is 1 - œÄ = 0.50. So, P(Y = 0) = (1 - œÄ)^2 = 0.50^2 = 0.25. - P(Y = 1): This is the probability that one individual supports an increase and the other does not.
There are two ways this can happen: either the first individual supports and the second does not, or the first does not support and the second does.
So, P(Y = 1) = 2 * œÄ * (1 - œÄ) = 2 * 0.50 * 0.50 = 0.50. - P(Y = 2): This is the probability that both individuals in the sample support an increase in the minimum wage.
So, P(Y = 2) = œÄ^2 = 0.50^2 = 0.25. Now, we can find the mean and standard deviation of the distribution.
The mean is given by Œº = E(Y) = Œ£ [y * P(Y = y)]. So, Œº = 0 * P(Y = 0) + 1 * P(Y = 1) + 2 * P(Y = 2) = 0 * 0.25 + 1 * 0.50 + 2 * 0.25 = 0 + 0.50 + 0.50 = 1. The variance is given by œÉ^2 = E(Y^2) - Œº^2.
First, we find E(Y^2): E(Y^2) = Œ£ [y^2 * P(Y = y)] = 0^2 * P(Y = 0) + 1^2 * P(Y = 1) + 2^2 * P(Y = 2) = 0 * 0.25 + 1 * 0.50 + 4 * 0.25 = 0 + 0.50 + 1 = 1.50.
Now, we can find the variance: œÉ^2 = E(Y^2) - Œº^2 = 1.50 - 1^2 = 1.50 - 1 = 0.50. Finally, we find the standard deviation: œÉ = ‚àöœÉ^2 = ‚àö0.50 ‚âà 0.71.

2. When the 2010 General Social Survey asked subjects in the US whether they would be willing to accept cuts 
in their standard of living to protect the environment, 486 of 1374 subjects said yes.

a. Estimate the population proportion who would say yes. Construct and interpret a 99% confidence interval for this proportion.

b. Conduct a significance test to determine whether a majority or minority of the population would say yes. 
Report and interpret the P-value.

*The Wald test, the score test, and the likelihood ratio test may yield the same conclusion regarding rejection, but the test statistics may differ.
When choosing one of the three methods, the analyst should select the most appropriate one. 
The likelihood ratio test is characterized by using the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) directly, while the score test always uses the maximized value of ùúã(ùúã0), 
resulting in a standard error (SE) that is always larger than that used in the Wald test, which employs pi-hat. 
Therefore, the z-value, which uses SE as the denominator, will be smaller, leading to a more conservative approach to rejection (less likely to reject the null hypothesis). 
SAS shows all three cases, but R applies different testing methods depending on the form used.
